### Activating the Virtual Environment in Visual Studio Code

    1. **Open Visual Studio Code**.

    2. **Open the Command Palette**:
       - On Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
       - On Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`

    3. **Select the Python Interpreter**:
       - Type `Python: Select Interpreter` in the Command Palette and select it.
       - Choose your virtual environment from the list. If your virtual environment is not listed, select `Enter interpreter path` and navigate to the `python` executable inside your virtual environment. For example:
         - On Windows: `env\Scripts\python.exe`
         - On Mac/Linux: `env/bin/python`

    4. **Verify the Interpreter Path**:
       - Open the `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project directory. It should look something like this:
         ```json
         {
             "python.pythonPath": "env\\Scripts\\python.exe"  // Windows
             // "python.pythonPath": "env/bin/python"  // Mac/Linux
         }
         ```

    5. **Activate the Virtual Environment in the Terminal**:
       - Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
       - The virtual environment should be activated automatically. You should see the virtual environment name in the terminal prompt, like `(env)`.

    6. **Manually Activate the Virtual Environment (if needed)**:
       - If the virtual environment is not activated automatically, you can manually activate it:
         - On Windows:
           ```sh
           env\Scripts\activate
           ```
         - On Mac/Linux:
           ```sh
           source env/bin/activate
           ```

    ### Additional Tips

    - **Install the Python Extension**: Make sure you have the Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code. It provides rich support for Python, including IntelliSense, linting, and debugging.
    - **Check the Terminal**: If the virtual environment is activated, you should see the environment name in the terminal prompt, e.g., `(env)`.

    By following these steps, you can ensure that your virtual environment is activated automatically whenever you open your project in Visual Studio Code.
